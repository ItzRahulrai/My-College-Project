# My-College-Project

I am going to be building a food ordering website for my college project. 
The code of the website is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

This is my college project, so I have a team also of 2 more members.They contributed equally with me
we build this with the help of online resources

The content of the website is written in HTML and CSS. The scripts are written in JavaScript.

The homepage of the website has a search bar where users can search for food items they want to order from a restaurant's menu. 
addresses and ratings from other customers who have ordered from those restaurants before.

They can then call restaurant or click on "order" button next to any item 
which will take them to the online order form where they can place an order for that item with the restaurant and 
pay through credit card or cash on delivery option available there.
